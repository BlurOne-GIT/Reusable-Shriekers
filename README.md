## The idea
Ever wanted the Sculk Shrieker you mined with Silk Touch to be able to spawn Wardens when placed once again? This plugin makes it a feature!

## How to use
Click on a deactivated Sculk Shrieker while holding an Echo Shard to reactivate it, allowing it to summon Wardens again.

## Configs
- You can change the item used to reactivate the Sculk Shrieker (Echo Shard by default). Other options I'd recommend are a Recovery Compass or a Nether Star.
- You can enable a logger that will show a message in console when a player reactivates a Sculk Shrieker.
